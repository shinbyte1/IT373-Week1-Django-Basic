# Reflection: Environment Setup

Setting up the development environment posed challenges for me. I initially had issues for I'm not really good at this because of being new to this environment. I started by installing Python and configure my shell to properly check the version of Python I'm using. I took so long for creating an environment for the scripts are not bypassed at first. I didn't bother looking at the manual Dr. Paragas gave us but I saw myself struggling doing it by myself. But I did bypass it later on and started using the virtual environment.

After installing Python and activating the virtual environment, installing Django was a piece of cake as it is more straightforward because I didn't encounter any scripts here. 

This part really hits me hard, the part where I'm going to setup the Git remote. I didn't know that multiple accounts in Github would really matter when pushing commits and changes. I've been having too much time here because I can't push and add new files to the account, I'm going to push it into but rather to my old account. I just deleted my old account for I have access to it.

Through these issues, I learned to carefully read error messages and consult the official documentation. It reinforced the importance of setting up environments methodically to avoid bigger issues later in development.
